How to use Triggers in SQL Sever. 

A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically runs when an event occurs in the database server.
DML triggers run when a user tries to modify data through a data manipulation language (DML) event. 
DML events are INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements on a table or view.

It is better to add a trigger to prevent future Database crash and know the specific time when a DML command has been tried to input.
